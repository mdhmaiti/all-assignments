Sure! Here are some better examples of using the spread operator (`...`) to create new objects and extend existing ones:

**1. Merging Multiple Objects:**

You can use the spread operator to merge multiple objects into a single new object. For example:

```javascript
const defaultConfig = { theme: 'light', fontSize: '16px' };
const userConfig = { fontSize: '18px', showNotifications: true };

const mergedConfig = { ...defaultConfig, ...userConfig };
console.log(mergedConfig);
```

Output:

```json
{
  "theme": "light",
  "fontSize": "18px",
  "showNotifications": true
}
```

Here, `mergedConfig` contains the properties from both `defaultConfig` and `userConfig`. If there are overlapping properties, the ones in `userConfig` take precedence.

**2. Cloning an Object:**

You can clone an object by using the spread operator to create a shallow copy. Modifying the cloned object won't affect the original object. For example:

```javascript
const originalObject = { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' };
const clonedObject = { ...originalObject };

clonedObject.key1 = 'new_value';

console.log(originalObject); // Output: { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }
console.log(clonedObject);   // Output: { "key1": "new_value", "key2": "value2" }
```

**3. Merging Arrays:**

You can also use the spread operator to merge arrays. For example:

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];

const mergedArray = [...array1, ...array2];
console.log(mergedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

**4. Removing Properties from an Object:**

You can use the spread operator along with destructuring to remove properties from an object. For example:

```javascript
const originalObject = { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2', key3: 'value3' };
const { key2, ...remainingObject } = originalObject;

console.log(key2);           // Output: "value2" (extracted property)
console.log(remainingObject); // Output: { "key1": "value1", "key3": "value3" }
```

**5. Updating an Object with New Properties:**

You can also use the spread operator to add new properties to an existing object. For example:

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
const updatedPerson = { ...person, city: 'New York', country: 'USA' };

console.log(updatedPerson);
```

Output:

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York",
  "country": "USA"
}
```

These are just a few examples of how the spread operator can be used to create new objects, merge objects or arrays, clone objects, and update objects in a concise and efficient manner. The spread operator is a powerful feature that simplifies many common object and array operations in JavaScript.
